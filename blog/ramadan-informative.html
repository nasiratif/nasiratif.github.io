<img alt="Bismillāhir-Raḥmānir-Raḥīm" class="bismillah" src="/img/bismillah.png">

<p>Alḥamdulillāh, the month of <i>Ramaḍān</i> has reached us. It is the time in which the Muslims fast, contemplate over the Qurʾān, and increase in the obedience of Allāh (عز و جل).</p>

<p>To help get you started, in this article I will discuss a few brief points about this blessed month, ʾIn shāʾ Allāh.</p>

<h2>A blessed month has come to us</h2>

<p>During the month of <i>Ramaḍān</i>, one increases and strives in performing good deeds and in the worship of Allāh (عز و جل). There also comes in an authentic <i>Ḥadīth</i> that the Prophet (ﷺ) used to give glad tidings to his companions whenever <i>Ramaḍān</i> arrived.</p>

<p>It's been narrated that he (ﷺ) would say to his companions:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"<i>Ramaḍān</i> has come to you, a blessed month, which Allāh has obligated you to fast. In it the gates of Paradise are opened, the gates of Hell are closed, and the devils are chained up. There is a night in it, which is better than a thousand months. Whoever is deprived of its goodness is indeed deprived." <a href="#ft1">(1)</a></p>

<p>Indeed, <i>Ramaḍān</i> is the best season to turn back to Allāh. Every believer rejoices with happiness regarding the arrivial of this month.</p>

<h2>Abstaining from food and drink</h2>

<p>During the month of <i>Ramaḍān</i>, one abstains from consuming food and drink from <i>Fajr</i> to <i>Maġhrib</i>.</p>

<p>On the authority of Abū Hurairah (رضي الله عنه), the Prophet (ﷺ) said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"Whoever stands in prayer on the night of Divine Decree out of true faith and awaiting His recompense, then his previous sins will be forgiven. Whoever fasts the month of <i>Ramaḍān</i> out of true faith and awaiting His recompense, then his previous sins will be forgiven." <a href="#ft2">(2)</a></p>

<p>The wisdoms of fasting are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Purifying the soul, cleanse it from evil deeds and increase the manners of oneself, as fasting restricts the passages in which the Shaiṭān flows through the body of someone.</li>
<li>Fasting makes one's primary concern the Hereafter and worries less about the <i>Dunyā</i>.</li>
<li>Fasting makes one concerned about the poor and it gives them a feeling of the pain that they go through, as fasting gives you a taste of the pain of hunger and thirst.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also chances one may be excused from fasting, such as the sick and the traveller:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"The month of Ramaḍān [is that] in which was revealed the Qurʾān, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So whoever sights [the crescent of] the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey — then an equal number of other days. Allāh intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to complete the period and to glorify Allāh for that [to] which He has guided you; and perhaps you will be grateful." <a href="#ft3">(3)</a></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Alḥamdulillāh, you've taken the time to benefit yourself about some of the greatest points regarding the month of <i>Ramaḍān</i>. I ask Allāh to allow us to take full advantage of this blessed month, and allow us to live long enough to reach the next Ramaḍān, ʾIn shāʾ Allāh.</p>

<p>May Allāh bless you, and shukran.</p>
