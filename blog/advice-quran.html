<p>The following piece of advice is from Sheikh Abd al-Razzāq al-Badr (حفظه الله)'s explanation on some lines of poetry by Sheikh Ḥāfidh al-Ḥakami (رحمه الله) regarding contemplation of Allāh (عز و جل)'s Book. It has been extracted from the book, <i>Advice Regarding the Book of Allah</i>, published by Authentic Statements Publications:</p>

<h2>Poem</h2>

<h2 class="quote">"And with contemplation and a slow, measured recital, thus recite the Book of Allāh, especially during the pitch-black darkness."</h2>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p>Abd al-Razzāq al-Badr (حفظه الله) commented:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"In his statement, 'With contemplation and a slow, measured recital,' the preposition and the noun following it are connected to his statement, 'thus recite the Book of Allāh', meaning recite the Book of Allāh with contemplation and a slow, measured recital. Allāh has commanded us to reflect and contemplate His book in various <i>Ayāt</i> in the Qurʾān. Allāh the Exalted said:</p>

<h2 class="quote">'Do they not then contemplate the Qurʾān carefully? Had it been from other than Allāh, they would surely have found therein many contradictions.' <a href="#ft1">(1)</a></h2>

<p class="mini-quote">And the Exalted said:</p>

<h2 class="quote">'Then do they not reflect upon the Qurʾān, or are there locks upon [their] hearts?' <a href="#ft2">(2)</a></h2>

<p class="mini-quote">And the Exalted said:</p>

<h2 class="quote">'Have they not pondered over the Word or has there come to them what had not come to their fathers of old?' <a href="#ft3">(3)</a></h2>

<p class="mini-quote">And the Exalted said:</p>

<h2 class="quote">'(This is) a Book (the Qurʾān) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its <i>Ayāt</i>, and that men of understanding may remember.' <a href="#ft4">(4)</a></h2>

<p class="mini-quote">These <i>Ayāt</i> incite us to contemplate the Book of Allah (عز و جل). Contemplating is implemented by reflecting over its meanings, pondering its guidance, and comprehending the intent of Allāh. the Exalted, such that the slaves portion from the Qurʾān includes his recitation of the letters, and understanding its meanings and guidance. And his portion is not merely reciting the letters properly.</p>

<p class="mini-quote">His statement, 'a slow, measured recital', means a recitation that is deliberate; because this will assist you in understanding and pondering it. There is a difference between the individual who recites a chapter of the Qurʾān while he wants to comprehend what Allāh (عز و جل) is saying to him in these <i>Ayāt</i>, and the individual who recites it while he wants to finish it and relieve himself of its recitation.</p>

<p class="mini-quote">The poet (رحمه الله) began with an incitement to recite the Qurʾān with contemplation and a slow, measured recital. This advice is in accordance with many <i>ayāt</i> in the Book of Allāh (عز و جل), and a number of <i>aḥādīth</i> found in the <i>Sunnah</i> of the Prophet (ﷺ). The Qurʾān comes with an incitement to give great concern to reciting the Qurʾān with and slow, measured recital, and reflection and contemplation. Allāh, the Exalted, said:</p>

<h2 class="quote">'And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord.' <a href="#ft5">(5)</a></h2>

<p class="mini-quote">And He said:</p>

<h2 class="quote">'Those to whom We have given the Book recite it with its true recital. They [are the ones who] believe in it.' <a href="#ft6">(6)</a></h2>

<p class="mini-quote">And His statement:</p>

<h2 class="quote">'Not all of them are alike; a party of the people of the Scripture stand for the right, they recite the <i>Ayāt</i> of Allāh during the hours of the night, prostrating themselves in prayer.' <a href="#ft7">(7)</a></h2>

<p class="mini-quote">And His statement:</p>

<h2 class="quote">'Verily, those who recite the Book of Allāh, and establish the prayer, and spend (in charity) out of what We have provided fro them, secretly and openly, hope for a (sure) trade gain that will never perish.' <a href="#ft8">(8)</a></h2>

<p class="mini-quote">The <i>ayāt</i> with this meaning are numerous. Likewise, there are <i>aḥādīth</i> in the Sunnah that incite recitation of the Qurʾān with a recitation that is slow and deliberate, with reflection; along with mentioning the virtue of doing so. The Prophet (ﷺ) said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote"><b>'Which of you would love to go out every morning to Burhan or al-'Aqiq and bring two large-humped, far she-camels without being guilty of sin or severing ties or relationship? They said, 'Messenger of Allāh, we would all love that.' He said, 'If any one of you gives out in the morning to the masjid and learns or recites two <i>ayāt</i> from the Book of Allāh (عز و جل), it is better for him than two she-camels. And three <i>ayāt</i> are better for him than three she-camels, and four <i>ayāt</i> are better for him than four camels, and so on to the corresponding number in camels.''</b> <a href="#ft9">(9)</a></p>

<p class="mini-quote">And he (ﷺ) said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote"><b>'No people gather together in a house of the houses of Allāh, The Most High, reciting the Book of Allāh, and learning it together among themselves, except that calmness descends upon them, mercy covers them, the angels surround them, and Allāh makes a mention of them among those who are with Him.'</b> <a href="#ft10">(10)</a></p>

<p class="mini-quote">And his (ﷺ) statement:</p>

<p class="mini-quote"><b>'Whoever recites a letter from the Book of Allāh will have a good deed, and a good deed of ten the like of it. I do not say that alif (Arabic: ا) lām (Arabic: ل) mīm (Arabic: م) is a letter, but alif is a letter, lām is a letter, and mīm is a letter.'</b> <a href="#ft11">(11)</a></p>

<p class="mini-quote">The poet (رحمه الله) said, 'especially during the pitch-black darkness,' meaning 'especially during this blessed time'.</p>

<p class="mini-quote">Imam Nawawī (رحمه الله) said in <i>Clarifying the Manners of Carrying the Qur'an</i> page 75, in the chapter <i>'The Preferred Time To Recite'</i>:</p> 

<p class="mini-quote"><b>'Know that the best time for recitation is recitation within the prayer. As for recitation outside of the prayer, then the best recitation is during the night; and the last part of the night is better than the first part of the night.'</b>"</p>

<p>And Allāh (ﷻ) knows best.</p>

<p>I ask Allāh (عز و جل) to allow us to act upon and ponder upon His Book sincerely whenever we read it ʾIn shāʾ Allāh. May Allāh bless you, and shukran.</p>
