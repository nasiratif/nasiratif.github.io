<p class="mini-quote">"He (رحمه الله) became famous from a very early age for his perception and brilliance as well as his serious interest in seeking knowledge and acquriring it. A proper learning environment was available to him and he was serious in pursuit of knowledge and thus strove hard, exerted much effort, stayed up nights and continued for days in pursuit of it. And he continued on the path of knowledge and proceeded forward without desiring anything else but to acquire it. The people who describe him continue to mention his seriousness in pursuit of knowledge and his commitment to it and learning and due to this, he was able to achieve a significant level of knowledge in the Islāmic sciences." <a href="#ft1">(1)</a></p>

<p class="mini-quote">"He consistently attended the lessons of the scholars and whomever he felt might grant him even the smallest amount of benefit without any arrogance or partiality. He continued and perserved and exerted all of his efforts on the path until he attined in his youth what others do not acquire over an extremely long period of time in terms of mastery of numerous sciences, disciplines and various skills."</p>
