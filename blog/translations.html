<img alt="Bismillāhir-Raḥmānir-Raḥīm" class="bismillah" src="/img/bismillah.png">

<p>One of the things I have been wondering and probably many others was that "What do we say in English when we start praying?" In this article, I will provide the answers to that.</p>

<h2 class="quote"><br>Allahu Akbar الله أكبر - Allah is the greatest.</h2>

<p>When we say "Allahu Akbar" while praying, it means we are saying that Allah (subhanahu wa ta'ala) is the greatest of all, and it is what we say when we start the prayer or next Rakat and also one of the things we say to praise Allah.</p>

<h2 class="quote">Surah Al-Fatihah الفاتحة - "In the Name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful. All praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds. the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful, Master of the Day of Judgement. You alone we worship and You alone we ask for help. Guide us along the Straight Path, the Path of those You have blessed, not those You are displeased with, or those who are astray."</h2>

<p>After we say Allahu Akbar at the beginning of the prayer (or rakat), we recite the entirety of Surah Al-Fatihah, which is the first Surah of the Holy Qur'an, and consists of 7 rakats and also describes Allah's Oneness and Power.</p>

<p>It is also obligatory to recite Surah al-Fatihah at the beginning of every Rakat or prayer, or the prayer is considered invalid if it has not been recited even just once.</p>

<h2 class="quote">Subhana Rabbiyal Adheem سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الأَعْلَى - Glory be to my Lord.</h2>

<p>This is another one of the words that we say after saying Allahu Akbar and going into Ruku', and in which we show glory our Lord (subhanahu wa ta'ala).</p>

<h2 class="quote">Samiallah Huliman Hamidah, Rabbana Wa Lakal Hamd سمع الله لمن حمده, ربنا ولك الحمد - Allah hears whoever praises Him, Our Lord, to You be all praised.</h2>

<p>We say this right after we finish saying Subhana Rabbiyal Adheem. and then say Allahu Akbar after and go into Sujood (prostration).</p>

<h2 class="quote">Subhana Rabbi Al A'ala سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الأَعْلَى - Glory to my Lord, the Most High.</h2>

<p>When in Sujood, we say this 3 times and after that, we go into Julus and say Allahu Akbar again.</p>

<h2 class="quote">Rabbighfirli رَبِّ اغْفِرْ لِي - Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me.</h2>

<p>This is actually a Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ, where the Muslim, while in Julus, says this Du'a twice asking for forgiveness.</p>

<h2 class="quote">Tashahud التَّشَهُّدَ - "All the compliments are for Allah, and all of the prayers and all of the good things (are for Allah (subhanahu wa ta'ala).). Peace be upon you, O Prophet of Allah, and Allah's mercy and blessings are upon you."</h2>

<p>After we bow down after saying Rabbighfirli twice, we go into Julus and say Allahu Akbar again, then recite the Tashahud.</p>

<h2 class="quote">Salawat صَلَوَات - "O Allah, bestow your blessings on Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the family of Muhammad (peace be upon him), as you have blessed Ibrahim and his family."</h2>

<p>The salawat is the blessings which we give on the Prophet ﷺ, and is one of the last things we do in the prayer.</p>

<h2 class="quote">Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah أسلم عليكم و رحمتلله - May the peace and mercy of Allah be upon you.</h2>

<p>After the salawat, we turn the the right first and say this, and then turn to the left and say it again.</p>

<p>This is also when the prayer is finished, and we perform the Dhikr after we finish the prayer.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The translations of prayer are one of the very fundamental things to have knowledge of!</p>

<p>May Allah bless you, and shukran.</p>
