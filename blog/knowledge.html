<p>As Muslims, we are obligated to seek islamic knowledge by the Prophet (ﷺ) <a href="#ft1">(1)</a> and because of this and many other reasons, This article will explain the 5 best ways to seek islamic knowledge, and why it is beneficial.</p>

<h2>1. Qur'an</h2>

<p>The number 1 best choice of islamic knowledge is the Qur'an of course. It is the holy book of Islam, revealed in the holy month of Ramadan, and contains tons of knowledge to be discovered.</p>

<p>If you don't have a Qur'an, make sure to pick one up at your local Islamic bookstore, or order a copy online to get one of the most beneficial and important books.</p>

<p>The Qur'an was also revealed by Allah to the Angel Jibreel in the month of Ramadan like I have mentioned earlier, then taught the Qur'an to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.</p>

<h2>2. Sunnah</h2>

<p>The Sunnah is the way of the Prophet ﷺ. It is found from various hadith books like Sahih Al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. It is also reported by several narrators like Abu Hurairah, and like the Qur'an, contains a ton of knowledge to be found. And also the plural word of "Hadith" is Ahadith.</p>

<p>Make sure to be cautious of fabricated Ahadith, which are made up Hadiths. It is recommended to get Ahadith only from authentic Hadith books, like Sahih Al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, and Sunan ibn Majah.</p>

<p>Also look to find the grade of the Hadith, which can be Sahih (authentic), Hasan (good), and the worst of all, Daif (weak). It is recommended to not follow Daif Ahadith at all.</p>

<h2>3. Books from scholars</h2>

<p>From your local islamic bookstore you can find various Islamic books compiled by numerous Islamic scholars, like Salih Al-Fawzan. These books can also be highly beneficial, I recommend books like Forty Hadith and The Book of Tawhid, 2 books which are profound. There are more beneficial books like these obviously.</p>

<p>You can also order these books online from websites like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sifatusafwa.com">Sifatu Safwa</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://onlineislamicbook.com">Online Islamic Book</a>.</p>

<h2>4. Khutbah from masjid</h2>

<p>From your local Masjid (mosque), you can do special acts of worship and listen to the Khutbah (sermon). This like all the others can be very beneficial, the Imam (mosque leader), usually the host of the Khutbah, will share facts and benefits in the Khutbah to strengthen your Iman (belief), manners and much more.</p>

<p>Also, I recommend going to Salafi Masjids, those which usually include better benefits from regular Masjids.</p>

<h2>5. Read Fatwas</h2>

<p>Last of them all, Fatwas are rulings given by numerous islamic scholars, and they usually explain if something is recommended, permissible to do, or impermissible to do.</p>

<p>Some scholars who usually give Fatwas are Sheikh ibn Baz (رحمه الله) and Salih al-Fawzan (حفظه الله). You can find fatwas from various Islamic websites and other types, some websites being <a target="_blank" href="">Abu Khadeejah</a> and much more.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I have explained multiple sources to get Islamic knowledge from. It is beneficial due to the fact that knowledge can strengthen your Iman and piety.</p>

<p>May Allah bless you, and shukran.</p>
