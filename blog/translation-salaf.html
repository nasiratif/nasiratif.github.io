<img alt="Bismillāhir-Raḥmānir-Raḥīm" class="bismillah" src="/img/bismillah.png">

<p>One of the actions that the Salaf did was translate books, sermons and any benefit to one's native language.</p>

<p>Abdullah ibn al-Harith ibn Nawfal said:</p>

<h2 class="quote">“Umar (رضي الله عنه) addressed us at Jabiyah
(a town in Syria) while there were Catholics standing among us and a translator was
translating.”</h2>

<p>Shaykh Abdul Razzaq al-Badr stated about this:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">“This narration contains a great benefit related to translating. Translating sermons, reminders, talks and books into various languages is from the methodology of the Salaf may Allah have mercy upon them. Translating is a known practice of the Salaf. Translating contains a great deal of good because the person who does not understand the Arabic language is not able to benefit from the sermons, admonitions, or books, without someone to translate into their native language.</p>

<p class="mini-quote">From the greatest achievements of the student of knowledge who speak languages other than Arabic is that Allah grant them success to return to his land and transmit this knowledge in the language of his people and bring this goodness to his people in their native language. How many people has Allah benefitted—no one knows the number except Him; by way of students of knowledge who were diligent and sought the help of Allah until they acquired a good amount of knowledge and then they conveyed it to their people in their native language to include sermons, lessons, and books they translated."</p>

<p>May Allah bless you, and shukran.</p>
