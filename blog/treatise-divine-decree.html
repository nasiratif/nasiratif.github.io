<p>A Treatise Regarding the Divine Decree and Foreordainment is a concise book aimed towards benefitting Muslims more about <i>Qadr</i> (divine decree). I say that this book has important benefits as it really goes into detail about Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى)'s power, His unique abilities and the divine decree and foreordainment.</p>

<p>One of the topics it starts with is the mentioning that it has been reported that the Prophet ﷺ came out to his companions whilst they were debating regarding the <i>Qadr</i>, and he prohibited them from doing so and informed them that:</p>

<h2 class="quote">"Nothing destroyed those who were before you except this disputation." <a href="#ft1">(1)</a></h2>

<p>And it also mentions the aspects of <i>Tawḥīd</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tawḥīd al-Uluhīyah (Oneness of Allāh's Worship) — It is to single out Allāh, the Exalted, with worship.</li>
<li>Tawḥīd ar-Rububīyah (Oneness of Allāh's Lordship) — It is to single out Allāh with creation, ownership, and management.</li>
<li>Tawḥīd al-Asma wa-Sifāt (Oneness of Allāh's Names and Qualities)</li>
</ul>

<p>My personal favorite chapter of this book is <i>The Levels of the Divine Decree & Foreordainment</i>. This is something I have discussed in <a target="_blank" href="levels-of-qadr.html">another article</a>, but because of it's amazing benefits I will include it here as well:</p>

<ul>
<li>al-ʿIlm — Knowledge of Allāh's abilities.</li>
<li>al-Kitābah — Knowledge of the preserved tablet.</li>
<li>al-Mashī'ah — Knowledge that Allāh wills everything existent and non-existent.</li>
<li>al-Khalqh — Knowledge that Allāh created everything and that nothing is created except from Him.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another one of my favorites of this book is in page 20, it goes into detail about the fact that Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى) creates all actions of the creation. Actions consist of 2 affairs:</p>

<ul>
<li>al-Qudrah (Ability)</li>
<li>al-Iradah (Will)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the book it further states:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"Therefore, if the action of the servant is the result of his will and ability then the one who has created this will and has made the heart of the individual such that it possesses a will is Allāh, the Mighty and Majestic. Likewise, the One who has created the ability within him is Allāh, the Mighty and Majestic. He creates the cause and the effect; and we say indeed the Creator of the cause is likewise the Creator of the effect. Meaning, the Creator or the bringer about of the cause is likewise the creator of the effect."</p>

<p>It also explains that without the will and ability the action wouldn't have been done:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"Were it not for the will he would have not have done it and were it not for the ability then he would not have done it. This is because if he wills to do something, yet he is incapable of doing it then he will not do it due to the inability to do the action. And if he is able to do it but does not want to do it then he will not do it. Hence, since the action is the result of firm will and complete ability then the one who has created the will and the ability is Allāh. By way of this we know how it is possible for us to say that Allāh, the Exalted, is the Creator of the actions of the servant. Otherwise, the servant is the one who has done the action in reality. He is the one who performs the act of purification. He is the one who prays, he is the one who pays zakat, he is the one who fast, he is the one who performs hajj, and he is the one who performs umrah. He is likewise the one who sins and who is the one who obeys Allāh. However, these actions are all present by way of the will to perform them and the ability to perform them, which have been created by Allāh, the Mighty and Majestic. The affair is clear, and for Allāh is the praise."</p>

<p>As a conclusion, I think this book is a definite recommendation to beginner Muslims and just those who want to know more about the divine decree of Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى).</p>

<p>May Allāh bless you, and shukran.</p>
