<p>Halal (meaning lawful) meat is meat that is slaughtered in permissible means by Muslims. It is a recommendation to make sure that your meat is Halal. It is also important to take note of what animals are permissible and not permissble to slaughter and eat.</p>

<h2>What is the importance of Halal Meat?</h2>

<p>Eating Halal meat is a better choice than eating non-halal meat, as it is slaughtered according to Islamic law. Halal meat is also usually a pure type of meat that is free from harmful substances.</p>

<p>It is also believed that Halal meat tastes better than non-halal meat, and that it usually stays fresh for a longer period of time. Non-halal meat may contain substances not healthy for the body, such as containing blood.</p>

<p>The Qur'an states about Halal meat:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"Made lawful to you this day are At-Tayyibat [all kinds of Halal (lawful) foods, which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them." <a href="#ft1">(1)</a></p>

<h2>What meats are haram (unlawful) to eat?</h2>

<p>Meats such as pork are not permissible to eat, and meats that have been slaughtered as sacrifice to others than Allah. Meats permissbile to eat are meats of Ahlul-Kitab (People of the Book), beef, lamb, goat, chicken, etc.</p>

<p>The Qur'an says about this:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"Forbidden to you (for food) are: Al-Maitah (the dead animals - cattle - beast not slaughtered), blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which Allah's Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering, and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns - and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wilf animal - unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death) - and that which is sacrificed (slaughtered) on An-Nusub (stone altars)." <a href="#ft2">(2)</a></p>

<h2>How should one slaughter an animal islamically?</h2>

<p>Another reason for meats to be permissible to eat is that they must be slaughtered correctly. The slaughterman must be a Muslim, or from Ahlul-Kitab, and slaughtered using a sharp blade that does the least amount of pain. The slaughtered animal must be a halal animal, such as cows, chicken, goat, etc. Also, the name of Allah (subhanahu wa ta'ala) must be mentioned, by saying Bismillah at the time of slaughtering.</p>

<p>All of these requirements must be fulfilled for the meat to be considered Halal. If not, than it is not considered Halal meat.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>To sum it up, Halal meat is the correct meat to eat, but for it to be considered Halal, it must be slaughtered according to Islamic law.</p>

<p>May Allah bless you, and shukran.</p>
