<p>When being a Muslim, there are a lot of things and acts of worship that you can do, Praying, reading islamic books, giving in charity, etc.</p>

<p>In this short article, I will recommend things that you should always do as a Muslim, starting below:</p>

<h2>1. Offer Salat (prayer)</h2>

<p>As Muslims, an obligatory act of worship is that you must pray. We pray to Allah alone without partners 5 times every day. Praying to other than Allah is considered Shirk (polytheism) and is not accepted.</p>

<p>Make sure you ALWAYS offer the 5 obligatory prayers no matter what is happening in your life. It is the reason we were brought to this world; praying is an act of worship and we were created only to worship Allah alone without partners. This is stated with proof from the Qur'an:</p>

<h2 class="quote">"And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)." <a href="#ft1">(1)</a></h2>

<p>Not praying at all is hated by Allah and if you are in this state, you must repent to Allah (subhanahu wa ta'ala) and start praying again insha-allah.</p>

<h2>2. Give Zakat (charity)</h2>

<p>Something I recommend (and is obligatory) is to give in charity. In Islam, this is called Zakat. We pay our Zakat by donating our wealth to Muslim charities across the world. Zakat is obligatory and must be paid at least once a year.</p>

<p>Zakat is very rewarding and is beloved to Allah. In the Qur'an:</p>

<h2 class="quote">"And give Zakat (obligatory charity), and lend to Allah a goodly loan." <a href="#ft2">(2)</a></h2>

<h2>3. Seek Knowledge</h2>

<p>It is highly recommended and obligatory of a Muslim to seek knowledge whenever he can. Best sources to gain knowledge from are the Qur'an, the Sunnah, and islamic books.</p>

<p>Narrated Anas ibn Malik, the Prophet ﷺ said:</p>

<h2 class="quote">"Seeking knowledge is obligatory upon every Muslim." <a href="#ft3">(3)</a></h2>

<h2>4. Read Lots of Qur'an</h2>

<p>Reading a ton of Qur'an is appreciated by Allah and you can gain lots of rewards from it.</p>

<p>Also recite Qur'an if you are able to, that is also beloved to Allah (subhanahu wa ta'ala).</p>

<h2>5. Maintain Ties of Kinship</h2>

<p>Keep your ties of kinship by visiting family even if they are non-Muslims. This contains lots of rewards.</p>

<p>Anas ibn Malik (radi allahu anhu) reported that the Prophet ﷺ said:</p>

<h2 class="quote">"Anyone who wants to have his provision expanded and his term of life prolonged should maintain ties of kinship." <a href="#ft4">(4)</a></h2>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Being a Muslim is not easy. There are lots of tasks you'll need to do and there are things you may go through. But Allah will ease it all for you insha-allah. I hope you benefitted from this insha-allah!</p>

<p>May Allah bless you, and shukran.</p>
