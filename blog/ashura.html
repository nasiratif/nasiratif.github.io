<img alt="Bismillāhir-Raḥmānir-Raḥīm" class="bismillah" src="/img/bismillah.png">

<p>A very special day for Muslims is coming. It is the day of Ashura, a day where it is recommended to fast, and also gives large rewards.</p>

<p>Fasting itself, usually gives big rewards and there are other days which are recommended to be fasting on, like the first 10 days of Dhul-Hijjah.</p>

<p>This day also has a great significance, which I will get into detail here:</p>

<h2>Significance of Ashura</h2>

<p>The day of Ashura had great events. It is the day when Allah (subhanahu wa ta'ala) saved Musa and his people, and He also destroyed Pharaoh and his people.</p>

<p>By showing respect and graditude to Allah, Musa had fasted on this day, so we start fasting on this day as well.</p>

<p>Hadith for evidence:</p>

<p>Ibn Abbas reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came to Medina and he found the Jews fasting on the day of Ashura. He said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"What is this day you are fasting?” They said, “This is a great day in which Allah saved Moses and his people, and he drowned Pharaoh and his people. Moses fasted on it due to gratitude, so we also fast on it.” The Prophet said, “We are more deserving and are closer to Moses than you.” The Prophet fasted the day of Ashura and he commanded fasting on it." (Agreed upon.) <a href="#ft1">(1)</a></p>

<h2>Benefits of fasting the day of Ashura</h2>

<p>One of the benefits of fasting on this day is that it will expiate a year of sins.</p>

<p>Abu Qatadah reported: The Prophet ﷺ, was asked about fasting the day of Arafat and he said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">“It will expiate the sins of the previous and upcoming years.”</p>

<p>Then, the Prophet was asked about fasting the day of Ashura and he said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">“It will expiate the sins of the past year.” <a href="#ft2">(2)</a></p>

<p>There is also a Hadith in which the Prophet ﷺ discussed the recommendations of fasting this day:</p>

<p>Ibn Umar reported: The Prophet ﷺ, said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"Verily, Ashura is a day among the days of Allah. Whoever wishes to fast may do so, and whoever wishes to break his fast may do so." <a href="#ft3">(3)</a></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Ashura is a great day of fasting and gives great rewards for those who wish to fast this day.</p>

<p>And also, this is day where you should do many acts of worship, and give Zakat (charity), which will please Allah (subhanahu wa ta'ala) and increase the rewards of Ashura.</p>

<p>May Allah bless you, and shukran.</p>
