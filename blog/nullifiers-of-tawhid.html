<p>Indeed, we should strive with clinginess to the statement of <i>Tawḥīd</i>, as it is one of the very important beliefs of the Muslim.</p>

<p>It is important to have knowledge of the nullifiers of <i>Tawḥīd</i> to protect us from going astray from the correct monotheism (i.e, <i>Tawḥīd</i>).</p>

<p>The ten nullifiers are to be listed below, ʾIn shāʾ Allāh:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>1. </i>Believing that the guidance of the polytheists is more complete than the guidance of the Prophet (ﷺ).</li>
<li><i>2. </i>Believing that another legislation is better than the legislation that the Prophet (ﷺ) came with.</li>
<li><i>3. </i>Refusing to declare that the polythests and what they believe is disbelief.</li>
<li><i>4. </i>Joking or mocking anything from the religion of <i>Islām</i>, the rewards of Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى) and His punishments. Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى) says in al-Qurʾān:</li>
<p class="mini-quote">"And if you ask them, they will surely say, 'We were only conversing and playing.' Say, 'Is it Allāh and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?' Make no excuse; you have disbelieved [i.e., rejected faith] after your belief. If We pardon one faction of you — We will punish another faction because they were criminals." <a href="#ft1">(1)</a></p>
<li><i>5. </i>Assisting the idol worshippers over the Muslims with wealth, arms, or views.</li>
<li><i>6. </i>Believing in magic.</li>
<li><i>7. </i>Rejecting something from Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى) and or His Messenger (ﷺ). If his rejection was showed outwardly then he has disbelieved. If it was shown inwardly and not manifested then he is a hypocrite and will enter the lowest depths of <i>Jahannam</i>. Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى) says in al-Qurʾān:</li>
<p class="mini-quote">"And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allāh or denies the truth when it has come to him? Is there not in Hell a [sufficient] residence for the disbelievers?" <a href="#ft2">(2)</a></p>
<li><i>8. </i>Refusing to act upon something that the Prophet (ﷺ) came with, even if one believed in Allāh and His Messenger. Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى) says in al-Qurʾān:</li>
<p class="mini-quote">"And [mention] when We said to the angels, 'Prostrate before Adam'; so they prostrated, except for Iblees (i.e, Shaiṭān). He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers." <a href="#ft3">(3)</a></p>
<li><i>9. </i>Having doubts about Allāh and or His Messenger, or to doubt what came from Allāh and or His Messenger. Allāh says in al-Qurʾān:</li>
<p class="mini-quote">"And he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself. He said, 'I do not think that this will perish — ever. And I do not think the Hour will occur. And even if I should be brought back to my Lord, I will surely find better than this as a return.' His companion said to him while he was conversing with him, 'Have you disbelieved in He who created you from dust and then from a sperm-drop and then proportioned you [as] a man? But as for me, He is Allāh, my Lord, and I do not associate with my Lord anyone." <a href="#ft4">(4)</a></p>
<li><i>10. </i>Hating the Prophet (ﷺ). This is from hypocrisy and one will enter the lowest depths of <i>Jahannam</i> if he believes this.</li>
</ul>

<p>I ask Allāh to allow us to have firm belief in <i>Tawḥīd</i>, stay away from falling into these nullifiers, and make us of the <i>Muttaqūn</i>.</p>

<p>May Allāh bless you, and shukran.</p>
