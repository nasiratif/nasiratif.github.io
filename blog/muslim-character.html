<p>A duty of a Muslim is that he has strong piety, manners and good Iman. This is very important for the Muslim as this can benefit him and increase his chances of going to Paradise.</p>

<p>A few examples of a good Muslim is one who cares and provides for others, and benefitting others as well. This article will discuss some of the few characteristics a pious Muslim would have.</p>

<h2>Reading lots of Qur'an</h2>

<p>An amazing trait of the Muslim is that he reads as much Qur'an as he can.</p>

<p>The Qur'an is the holy book of Allah, revealed in Ramadan centuries ago and is the best book of knowledge.</p>

<p>As the Qur'an is a beneficial and important book, it is important to read as much of it, and if you can, you can attempt to read the entirety of it, which is a highly beneficial action.</p>

<h2>Seeking knowledge</h2>

<p>Following after reading the Qur'an, another great trait of a Muslim is that he seeks knowledge to the best of his ability. This was made obligatory by the Prophet ﷺ.</p>

<p>Anas ibn Malik (radi allahu anhu) reported that the Prophet ﷺ said:</p>

<h2 class="quote">"Seeking knowledge is obligatory upon every Muslim." <a href="#ft1">(1)</a></h2>

<p>Best ways to get knowledge are from islamic books like the Qur'an, authentic hadith books like Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, and books compiled by various scholars.</p>

<p>This is is one of the most important characteristics because knowledge is something very important. It is of course beneficial, and can strengethen your piety and Iman insha-allah.</p>

<p>Also, when beginning to seek knowledge, make sure to read books gradually and do not start with detailed books. Knowledge is recommended to be sought gradually.</p>

<h2>Giving Zakat (obligatory charity)</h2>

<p>Another action that is obligatory and a pious trait of a Muslim is that he gives Zakat.</p>

<p>Zakat is charity that is given with your wealth to help the needy people. This characteristic is another very important one, due to its high benefits on not only the charities you donate to, but to you as well, since this action is beloved to Allah (subhanahu wa ta'ala).</p>

<p>The Prophet ﷺ has also given advice on this:</p>

<p>Narrated ibn Abbas, the Prophet ﷺ said:</p>

<h2 class="quote">"Invite the people to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and I am Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and if they obey you to do so, then teach them that Allah has enjoined on them five prayers in every day and night (in twenty-four hours), and if they obey you to do so, then teach them that Allah has made it obligatory for them to pay the Zakat from their property and it is to be taken from the wealthy among them and given to the poor." <a href="#ft2">(2)</a></h2>

<h2>Offering Salat (prayer to Allah alone)</h2>

<p>An obligatory act of worship is that we offer 5 daily prayers every day in our life.</p>

<p>This is a great characteristic of a Muslim and it is most beloved to Allah (subhanahu wa ta'ala). The prayers that we offer are Fajr (dawn prayer), Dhuhr (noon prayer) Asr (afternoon prayer), Maghrib (sunset prayer), and Isha (night prayer).</p>

<p>Not offering the 5 daily prayers is hated upon, but it does have exceptions, like being ill and very weak.</p>

<p>Salat is very important and it is a great act of worship. Never miss just one prayer, always try to offer as much as you can.</p>

<h2>Visting family (keeping ties of kinship)</h2>

<p>Family is important and it is obligatory upon us Muslims to never abandon them.</p>

<p>This a good trait of a Muslim; he should visit his family as much as he is able to even if they are not Muslims.</p>

<p>Anas ibn Malik (radi allahu anhu) reported that the Prophet ﷺ said:</p>

<h2 class="quote">"Anyone who wants to have his provision expanded and his term of life prolonged should maintain ties of kinship." <a href="#ft3">(3)</a></h2>

<h2>Having great manners</h2>

<p>A good trait of a Muslim is his manners. A good Muslim must have strong manners and modesty; he should give greetings to people and of course always assist other people.</p>

<p>The Muslim should be kind to one another, make them happy, and have great times with one another. This is always an appreciated action.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this article, you have learned the important characteristics of a good Muslim.</p>

<p>The Prophet ﷺ spoke on character:</p>

<p>Usamah ibn Sharik reported that the Prophet ﷺ said:</p>

<h2 class="quote">"The most beloved people to Allah are those with the best character." <a href="#ft4">(4)</a></h2>

<p>May Allah bless you, and shukran.</p>
