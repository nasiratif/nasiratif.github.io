<img alt="Bismillāhir-Raḥmānir-Raḥīm" class="bismillah" src="/img/bismillah.png">

<p>Ḥadīth (plural: 'Aḥādīth') are sayings and traditions of the Prophet ﷺ that are usually narrated by companions of the Prophet ﷺ, then these narrations are compiled into a book by a scholar of Ḥadīth. Within many Aḥādīth, there contains sayings that instructs the Muslim to behave correctly and have good Īmān. Since they are numerous Aḥādīth of this topic, and that I like to discuss things in brief, this article will contain just 10 aḥādīth that teaches good behavior. These will be taken from the Forty Ḥadīth of Imām an-Nawawī, ʾIn shāʾ Allāh.</p>

<p>But before we get started, I will share a Ḥadīth on the explanation of Īmān and ʾIḥsān:</p>

<p>ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb (رضي الله عنه) said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"One day while we were sitting with the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, there appeared before us a man whose clothes were exceedingly white and whose hair was exceedingly black; no signs of journeying were to be seen on him and none of us knew him. He walked up and sat down by the Prophet ﷺ resting his knees against his and placing the palms of his hands on his thighs, then he said: 'O Muḥammad, tell me about Islām.' The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said: 'Islām is to testify that there is no god to be worshipped but Allāh and that Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allāh, to perform the prayers, to pay the Zakāt, to fast in Ramadan, and to make the pilgrimage to the House (i.e. Kaʿbah in Makkah) if you are able to do so.' He said: You have spoken rightly, and we were amazed at him asking him and saying that he had spoken rightly. He said 'Then tell me about Īmān.' He (i.e. the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ) said: 'It is to believe in Allāh, His angels, His books, His messengers, and the Last Day, and to believe in divine destiny (preordainment), both the good and the evil thereof.' He said: 'Then tell me about ʾIḥsān.' He said: 'It is to worship Allāh as though you are seeing Him, and while you see him not yet truly He sees you.'" (This Ḥadīth is longer, but shortened to just the explanation of Islām, Īmān, and ʾIḥsān.) <a href="#ft1">(1)</a></p>

<p>Now lets begin with the Aḥādīth of good behavior:</p>

<h2>1. Having good manners</h2>

<p>Narrated Abū Hurairah (رضي الله عنه), the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"Let him who believes in Allāh and the Last Day, either speak good or keep silent, and let him who believes in Allāh and the Last Day be generous to his neighbour, and let him who believes in Allāh and the Last Day be generous to his guest." <a href="#ft2">(2)</a></p>

<h2>2. Having good behavior</h2>

<p>Narrated Mu'adh ibn Jabal (رضي الله عنه), the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"Fear Allāh wherever you are, and follow up a bad deed with a good one and it will wipe it out, and behave well towards people." <a href="#ft3">(3)</a></p>

<h2>3. Perfection of faith</h2>

<p>Narrated Anas ibn Mālik (رضي الله عنه), the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"None of you [truly] be a believer until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself." <a href="#ft2">(2)</a></p>

<h2>4. Prohibit anger</h2>

<p>Abū Hurairah (رضي الله عنه) said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"A man said to the Prophet ﷺ: 'Counsel me.' He said: 'Do not become angry.' The man repeated [his request] several times, and he said: Do not become angry.'" <a href="#ft4">(4)</a></p>

<h2>5. Believe in Allāh and remain steadfast in believing in him</h2>

<p>Abū ʻAmr (رضي الله عنه) said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"I said: 'O Messenger of Allāh, tell me something about Islām which I can ask of no one but you.' He said: 'Say: I believe in Allāh — and thereafter be upright.'" <a href="#ft1">(1)</a></p>

<h2>6. Seek the good and lawful things</h2>

<p>Narrated Abū Hurairah (رضي الله عنه), the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"Allāh the Exalted is good and accepts only that which is good. Allāh has commanded the believers to do that which He commanded the Messengers, and the exalted has said: 'O (you) Messenger! Eat of the lawful things, and do righteous deeds.' And Allāh, the exalted has said" 'O you who believe! Eat of the lawful things wherewith We have provided you.' Then he mentioned [the cave of] a man who, having journeyed far, is dishevelled and dusty who spreads out his hands to the sky [saying]" O Rabb! O Rabb!' — while his food is unlawful, his drink is unlawful, his clothing unlawful, and he is nourished unlawful, so how can his invocation be accepted." <a href="#ft1">(1)</a></p>

<h2>7. Orders depend on ability</h2>

<p>Abū Hurairah (رضي الله عنه) said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"I heard the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ saying: 'What I have forbidden to you, avoid, and what I have ordered you [to do], do, as much of it as you can. It was only their excessive questioning and their disagreeing with their Prophets that those people who were before you destroyed.'" <a href="#ft2">(2)</a></p>

<h2>8. Proficiency in all things</h2>

<p>Narrated Shaddād ibn Aws (رضي الله عنه), the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"Verily Allāh has prescribed proficiency in all things. Thus, if you kill, kill well; and if you slaughter, slaughter well. Let each one of you sharpen his blade, and let him spare suffering to the animal he slaughters." <a href="#ft1">(1)</a></p>

<h2>9. The definition of righteousness</h2>

<p>Narrated an-Nawwas ibn Samʿan (رضي الله عنه), the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"Righteousness is good morality, and wrongdoing is that which wavers in your heart and which you dislike people finding out about." <a href="#ft1">(1)</a></p>

<h2>10. Removal of innovation</h2>

<p>Narrated ʿĀʾisha (رضي الله عنها), the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"He who innovates something in this matter of ours that is not of it will have it rejected." <a href="#ft2">(2)</a></p>

<p>I ask Allāh to allow us to act upon these Aḥādīth and be able to spread them accordingly.</p>

<p>May Allāh bless you, and shukran.</p>
