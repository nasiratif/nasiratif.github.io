<p>It is a must that one should believe in the oneness of Allāh and not associate any partners with Him, which is polytheism, a sin that is never forgiven (unless one repents from it before death).</p>

<p>In Allāh's (سبحانه و تعالى) book, there contains numerous <i>Āyat</i> that affirms His oneness. The Āyat are to be listed below, ʾIn shāʾ Allāh.</p>

<h2>1. Allāh is only to be worshipped</h2>

<p>Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى) says in His book:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"And whoever invokes (or worships) besides Allāh another deity for which he has no proof — then his account is only with his Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will not succeed." <a href="#ft1">(1)</a></p>

<h2>2. Do not ascribe partners to Allāh</h2>

<p>Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى) says in His book:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"And [mention, O Muḥammad], when Luqmān said to his son while he was instructing him, 'O my son, do not associate [anything] with Allāh. Indeed, association [with Him] is great injustice.'" <a href="#ft2">(2)</a></p>

<h2>3. Do not call upon other than Allāh</h2>

<p>Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى) says in His book:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"And [He revealed] that the <i>Masājid</i> (i.e., the term (<i>masājid</i>) here includes every place of worship or the earth in general) are for Allāh, so do not invoke (or worship) with Allāh anyone." <a href="#ft3">(3)</a></p>

<h2>4. Supplication is only for Allāh</h2>

<p>Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى) says in His book:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"To Him [alone] is the supplication of truth. And those they call upon besides Him do not respond to them with a thing, except as one who stretches his hands toward water [from afar, calling it] to reach his mouth, but it will not reach it [thus] (i.e, the analogy indicates that false deities will never respond to them at all). And the supplication of the disbelievers is not but in error [i.e., futility]." <a href="#ft4">(4)</a></p>

<h2>5. Allāh is the truth</h2>

<p>Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى) says in His book:</p>

<p class="mini-quote">"That is because Allāh is the True Reality, and that which they call upon other than Him is falsehood, and because Allāh is the Most High, the Grand." <a href="#ft5">(5)</a></p>

<p>I ask Allāh to keep us sincere in the religion of Islām, and allow us to act upon these glorious <i>Āyat</i> of al-Qurʾān.</p>

<p>May Allāh bless you, and shukran.</p>
