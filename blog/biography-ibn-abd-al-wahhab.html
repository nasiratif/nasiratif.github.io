<h2>His Birth and Lineage</h2>

<p>Sheikh al-Islām, Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhāb ibn Sulaimān al-Tamīmī, well known for one of his works <i>Kitāb at-Tawḥīd</i>, was born in 1115 AH in the city of Uyainah. He belonged to an honurable, righteous and scholarly family; his father Sheikh ʿAbd al-Wahhāb ibn Sulaimān was characterized by his profound scholarship and righteousness, and inherited an exalted status from his ancestor Sheikh Sulaimān ibn ʿAlī, who was the chief of the scholars and well versed in teaching, writing and giving verdict.</p>

<h2>His Education</h2>

<p>Sheikh al-Islām gained his primary education from his esteemed father at his native place and was nutured under his guidance. He had the intelligence to memorize the entire Qurʾān by heart at the age of ten. He read books of <i>Tafsīr</i>, <i>Ḥadīth</i>, and <i>Fiqh</i>. At this time, he was greatly interested in studying works of early scholars, such as Sheikh al-Islām ibn Taymīyyah and his noble disciple Allāma ibn al-Qayyim. He went through all of those books and well held on to the contents of them. While in maturity, he set out to perform <i>Hajj</i> in Makkah and benefitted from the scholars there.</p>

<h2>His Mission of <i>Da‘wah</i></h2>

<p>Sheikh al-Islām had started his mission of <i>Da‘wah</i>. He invited people to Tawḥīd (islamic monotheism) and guided them to the Book of Allāh (i.e. Qurʾān) and the <i>Sunnah</i> of the Prophet Muḥammad ﷺ. He urged upon the <i>ʿUlamāʾ</i> to strictly follow the Qurʾān and <i>Sunnah</i> and derive the issues directly from them. Forcibly, he contradicted the blind following of any scholar of the <i>Ummah</i> in preference to the Qurʾān and <i>Ḥadīth</i>.</p>

<h2>His Works</h2>

<p>Sheikh al-Islām, despite him being a man of <i>Da‘wah</i>, also engaged in writing also. A few of his works are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kitāb at-Tawḥīd</li>
<li>Kitāb al-Kabaair</li>
<li>Kashf ash-Shubbat</li>
<li>Mukhtaṣar Seerat ar-Rasool</li>
<li>Masā’il al-Jāhilīyah</li>
<li>Uṣūl al-Īmān</li>
</ul>

<p>..and many more.</p>

<p>May Allāh have abundant mercy on Sheikh Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhāb, and reward him for his great contributions to the religion of Islām.</p>

<p>May Allāh bless you, and shukran.</p>
