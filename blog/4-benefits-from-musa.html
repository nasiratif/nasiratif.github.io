<p>The story of Prophet Mūsā (عليه السلام) is one of the most insightful stories of all the Prophets that a Muslim can benefit from. Being that this article is a continuation of <a target="_blank" href="/blog/4-benefits-from-adam.html">4 Benefits from the Story of Ādam (عليه السلام)</a>, the information gathered here will be taken from the same book authored by Sheikh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Saʿdī (رحمه الله), The Stories of the Prophets, with minor changes to the original wording, ʾIn shāʾ Allāh.</p>

<h2>The First Benefit</h2>

<p>Allāh (عز و جل) showed His generousity towards Mūsā's (عليه السلام) mother by showing her that her son was not going to be treading any paths of evil. Afterwards, He (عز و جل) delivered glad tidings by returning her son to her. Had that not been the case, she would have been in deep worries and sorrows over the state of her son. He (عز و جل) returned him to her through his rejection of being breastfed by anyone except his own mother. This shows us that the grace of Allāh (عز و جل) towards His servants cannot be comprehended by the minds nor be expressed through words. If one were to sincerely ponder over this glad tiding, they would truly understand the mercy and grace of our Lord (عز و جل). Mūsā's mother (عليه السلام)'s son came to her whilst she was able to breastfeed him without needing to conceal it and does so whilst receiving a recompense. She is called his mother from every perspective.</p>

<p>This experience impacted her heart greatly and increased her in faith. This only further emphasizes and substantiates the statement of Allāh (عز و جل):</p>

<h2 class="quote">"But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you." <a href="#ft1">(1)</a></h2>

<p>This statement truly shines here because there was nothing more to the hatred of Mūsā's mother (عليه السلام) than for her son to fall into the hands of the household of Fir'aun (Pharaoh). But even though all of this took place, it ultimately resulted in good, as aforementioned, and there was a happy conclusion.</p>

<h2>The Second Benefit</h2>

<p>All the signs and morals of Allāh (عز و جل) that He displays from the previous nations are of benefit. A believer can find a light of guidance within them, since Allāh (عز و جل) narrates these stories for this reason. He (عز و جل) said in this very story:</p>

<h2 class="quote">"We recite to you from the news of Mūsā and Fir'aun in truth for a people who believe." <a href="#ft2">(2)</a></h2>

<h2>The Third Benefit</h2>

<p>If Allāh (عز و جل) decrees for something to happen, He prepares its occurrence by allowing it to happen in stages, as opposed to everything suddenly occurring all in one moment</p>

<h2>The Fourth Benefit</h2>

<p>If a nation gets into a state of weakness, they should not allow laziness to take over them in their pursuit for their rights, nor should they despair from rising to the best positions especially if they are oppressed. Just like how Allāh (عز و جل) saved the children of Isrā‘īl in their state of weakness and enslavement from Fir'aun and his allies, they then became firmly established in their own land and ruled over it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Allāhu Akbar. Allāh (عز و جل) narrates these beautiful stories for us to ponder over and benefit from. These stories and the events that He puts on His servants help us to further grasp the understanding of Allāh's (عز و جل) wisdom, grace, and mercy, as was the case of Mūsā's mother.</p>

<p>May Allāh bless you, and shukran.</p>
